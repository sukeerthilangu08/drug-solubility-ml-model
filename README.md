# LogS Prediction Using Machine Learning Regression Models

This repository documents the process of developing and evaluating machine learning models to predict the aqueous solubility (LogS) of chemical compounds. The project covers a complete data science workflow, from initial data exploration to final visualization of the results in Tableau.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview

This project explores the use of supervised regression techniques to predict the LogS value of molecules based on a set of chemical descriptors. Two primary models were developed and compared: a baseline Linear Regression model and a more complex Random Forest Regressor.

The workflow emphasizes best practices, including:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand feature distributions and relationships.
- **Feature Scaling** to standardize the data and improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation** using standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
- **Exporting Results** for external analysis and visualization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis:** Performs comprehensive EDA using statistical summaries and visualizations (histograms, heatmaps) to uncover insights.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implements feature scaling with `StandardScaler` to normalize the data, a crucial step for distance-based algorithms.
- **Model Comparison:** Trains and evaluates both a Linear Regression and a Random Forest model to compare their effectiveness on this dataset.
- **Tableau Integration:** Generates a clean CSV file (`drug_solubility_predictions.csv`) containing the actual and predicted values, ready for direct use in Tableau.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Run This Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sukeerthilangu08/drug-solubility-ml-model
    cd drug-solubility-ml-model
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4.  Open and run all cells in `first_ML_project.ipynb`. The notebook will automatically generate the `drug_solubility_predictions.csv` file in the project directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Visualizing Results in Tableau

The model's performance can be visually assessed by creating a scatter plot in Tableau.

1.  **Connect to Data**: Open Tableau Desktop and connect to the `drug_solubility_predictions.csv` file generated by the notebook.
2.  **Create the Scatter Plot**:
    *   Drag `predicted_logS_lr` (or `predicted_logS_rf`) to the **Columns** shelf.
    *   Drag `actual_logS` to the **Rows** shelf.
3.  **Analyze**: This plot visually represents the model's performance. A tighter, more linear cluster of points indicates a more accurate model. You can add a trend line from the "Analytics" pane to see the correlation more clearly.

*(Optional: You can insert a screenshot of your Tableau dashboard here)*

## Results

The performance metrics below were captured **before** feature scaling was implemented. After running the notebook with the new scaling code, these results (especially for Linear Regression) are expected to improve.

| Model              | Train MSE | Train R² | Test MSE | Test R² |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Linear Regression | 1.0075    | 0.7645   | 1.0207   | 0.7892  |
| Random Forest     | 1.0282    | 0.7597   | 1.4077   | 0.7092  |

**Observation**: Initially, the Linear Regression model showed better generalization. The Random Forest appeared to overfit the training data, a behavior that could be addressed with hyperparameter tuning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Future Work

To further improve this project, the following steps are recommended:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to find the optimal parameters for the Random Forest model to reduce overfitting and improve its predictive power.
- **Cross-Validation:** Implement k-fold cross-validation to get a more robust and reliable measure of model performance.
- **Explore Other Models:** Experiment with other powerful regression models, such as Gradient Boosting or Support Vector Regression (SVR).
